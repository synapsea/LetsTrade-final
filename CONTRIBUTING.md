## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Maintain the quality
2. Fix problems that are important to users
3. Follow the styleguides
4. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji
